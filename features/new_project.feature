  In order to create a new bookphile project
  As a scanner
  I want a New Project setup process on the main page

  @needs_file_cleanup
  Scenario: new project launch creates the necessary directories
    When I launch a new project called "foo"
    Then a new directory "projects/foo" will exist
    And a new directory "projects/foo/scans" will exist
    
    
  @needs_file_cleanup
  Scenario: loading images copies them into the project from the denoted path
    When I launch a new project called "foo"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test1.tif"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test3.tif"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test6.tif"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test2.jpeg"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test5.jpg"
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" contains "test4.png"
    And I load images into the project from directory "features/fixtures/test_images"
    Then directory "projects/foo/scans" should contain 6 files
    And directory "features/fixtures/test_images" should contain 6 files
